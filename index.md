## Investigation Statistics for the Canadian Armed Forces

### Background 

This dataset was is part of the [Open Canada Dataset collection](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/402358f9-2808-44f7-99b3-58f6f5f95b1f) in which the data explains its tracking of military police incidents and convictions known as the Security and Military Police Information System (SAMPIS). The data collected is between Jan 1, 2014 and March 31, 2019. This represents the number of investigations that took place during the above mentioned period.

Below is the data in it's regular CSV form. Note: I have removed the original column B as it was the french version of column A.

### Beginnings
To start this whole shebang off a quick and dirty wget is needed to get the file - "caf-investigations-od-2018.csv" from the interwebs onto my local machine. Once this was done, I wanted to take a quick look in excel just to see what the headers were and what the data initially was about. 

In CS I previously used Wget for simple uses such as downloading a file onto a virtual machine and so on but I never really understood how useful it would be when it comes to archives and historical data. Imagine having thousands or millions of text files, wget can make this a breeze (a long breeze, but we take what we can get). I feel like those who use wget for small things fail to appreciate the beauty of it.
